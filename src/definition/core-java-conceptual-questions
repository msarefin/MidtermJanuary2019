What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK is composed of
- javac - compiles java file to class files
- javadoc - used to create documentation
- javap - show the implementation of a class and its methods
- jdb - helps debug the codes
- JRE
    --Class loader - loads the class to JVM
    --JVM
        ---Bytecode verifier - points to memory where the class has been loaded
        ---garbage collector - releases objects and variables that are no longer needed
        ---security manager - imposes restrictions
        ---Execution engine(JIT) - converts byte code to machine language
What is IDE?
A.  IDE sntand for integrated development environment. Is is a software that allows programmers to code and compile and test software applications
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.  NetBeans, Eclipse, and Intellij
Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.  The java applications are codes and saved as .java files. The javac converts the .java to .class files.
    The class files are loaded to jvm by the class loader and saves the byte code to the method area.(Only one method area per JVM and it's a shared resource)
    in the heap objects are created for each .class by the JVM
    temperory variables are stored in the stack
    PC register keeps track of instruction that are to be executed
    Native method stack has acces to the runtime data area for the virtual machine.
    native method interface enables java code to call or be called by the native application which are specific to the hardware and the OS
    Garbage collector releases objects and variables that are no longer needed by the application.

what is class?
A. Class is blue print that defines the objects.
What is object?
A.  Objects are instance of class that have attributes and functions defined by the class
What is the entry point of an application?
A. The main method is the entry point of a java application

What is difference between path and classpath variables?

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Interface contains only abstract methods and final variables Abstract class contains both abstract methods and concrete methods.
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. You cannot create objects of a interface or Abstract class but you can create referance variables of them. You can also create anynomous classes of them. You can implement interface and extend Abstract classes to implement the abstract methods and variables.
what is Access Specifier?
A. Access specifiers determines the accessability of class and mthods across the project. class has two levels of accessability where as methods and nested classes have four levels of accessability
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. There are 4 concepts
- Abstraction: Abstract class and interface provides abstract methods without their implementation
- Encapsulation: Hides the data manipulation with the help of private methods, variabes and inner classes
- Inheritance: enables classes to acquire the features of other classes without the need of recreating them
- Polymorphism: Methods can be of various forms that have different implementations. There are two form of polymorphism:
    -- Overloading: Same method or constructor within the same class with different parameters or different number of parameters
    -- Overriding: Same method with the same parameter but different implementation between parent and child classes.
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.  A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. java.lang package is imported by default.
What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.  Application Programming Interface.
